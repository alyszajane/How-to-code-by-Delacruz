        <p>At first when it was announced that this is the task that we are about to do, I was kind of afraid as I am a forgetful person and I barely remember how to code anymore. I tried those applications that are mentioned by ma'am Pascua and they didn't work for me. It just made it more difficult for me because I am not familiar with how to navigate those apps. I watched tons of "how to code HTML" online to regain my memory of the basics of coding. And indeed, it worked like magic.</p>
        
        <p>It is of course, not easy. There are many problems that I personally encountered especially with debugging. Even though it is easy, I forgot how to center text or put them left or right. I spent a pretty good amount of time searching for solutions 'til I found one.</p> 
        
        <p>Another major problem I dealt with is the CSS part. It took me hours just putting it all together like a piece of puzzle. To be honest, I am thankful that even though there is a difficult problem I encountered, there would always be a tutorial or solution online that has helped me in creating this PETA.</p>
        
        <p>In the CSS part, I had a rough time fixing the nav{} like that part. It is the header so it must look presentable and nice, so I spent time fixing my code and removing unnecessary things and it is challenging for me since I really don't know much about CSS because we aren't taught much about it. I am basically clueless on what I'm doing in this part so I googled a little bit until I am satisfied with what I've created.</p>
        
        <p>All in all, it is challenging yet amazing that I get to do what I did back when I was in grade 11. It brings back the memories of when I was just learning to code and understand HTML. I am glad I finished it, though probably won't reach the deadline.</p>
